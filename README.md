Folder with code related to object detection in the CCTV cameras placed in the agricultural field.

These folder are default code for YOLO computer vision for object detection and also available in ONNX format which works well for edge devices. 

Please note: no weights are present in the folder as weights are being fine-tuned for agricultural use-case such as detecting snakes and many more. Weights will be released as soon as possible.
